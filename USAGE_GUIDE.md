## Schedule Searches Feature

### What It Does
Allows you to schedule searches to run automatically at a specific time, even if you close your browser.

### How to Use

#### To Schedule a Search:
1. Open the extension popup
2. Find the "Schedule Search" section
3. Click on the time picker input
4. Select your desired time (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM)
5. Configure your search settings:
   - Number of searches
   - Delay ranges
   - Auto-close preference
6. Click the "Schedule" button
7. You'll see a status message confirming when the search is scheduled

#### To Cancel a Scheduled Search:
1. Open the extension popup

3. Click "Cancel Schedule" to remove the scheduled task

### Important Notes
- If you select a time that has already passed today, the search will be scheduled for **tomorrow**
- The schedule persists even if you close the browser or restart your computer
- Scheduled searches use the settings you configured when you set up the schedule
- Only one search can be scheduled at a time
- The extension needs to be installed and enabled for scheduled searches to run

### Examples

**Example 1: Morning Routine**
- Set time to 09:00
- Configure 34 searches (typical daily limit)
- Enable auto-close
- Click Schedule
- Searches run automatically at 9 AM tomorrow

**Example 2: Lunch Break Automation**

- Configure your preferred settings
- Schedule for later today (if before 12:30 PM) or tomorrow
- Extension handles everything automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Close Not Working
- Make sure the checkbox is checked before starting searches
- The feature only works when searches complete successfully
- Tabs close 2 seconds after the last search finishes

### Schedule Not Triggering
- Verify the extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- Check that your computer/browser is running at the scheduled time
- Ensure you didn't cancel the schedule accidentally
- Check the browser's alarm permissions

### General Tips
- You can still use "Start Searches" for immediate execution
- The manual "Close All Tabs" button works independently of auto-close
- All original features work exactly as before
