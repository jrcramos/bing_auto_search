## Schedule Searches Feature

### What It Does
Allows you to schedule searches to run automatically **every day** at a specific time. The schedule repeats daily until you cancel it, and works even if you close your browser.

### How to Use

#### To Schedule a Recurring Daily Search:
1. Open the extension popup
2. Find the "Schedule Search" section
3. Click on the time picker input
4. Select your desired time (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM)
5. Configure your search settings:
   - Number of searches
   - Delay ranges
   - Auto-close preference
6. Click the "Schedule" button
7. You'll see a status message showing "Daily schedule:" with the next run time

#### To Cancel a Scheduled Search:
1. Open the extension popup
2. If a search is scheduled, the button will show "Cancel Schedule"
3. Click "Cancel Schedule" to stop the daily recurring schedule

### Important Notes
- **Recurring Daily**: Once scheduled, searches will run **every day** at the same time until you cancel
- If you select a time that has already passed today, the first run will be scheduled for **tomorrow**
- The schedule persists even if you close the browser or restart your computer
- Scheduled searches use the settings you configured when you set up the schedule
- Only one recurring schedule can be active at a time
- The extension needs to be installed and enabled for scheduled searches to run
- Your browser must be running (even in the background) for the scheduled search to execute

### Examples

**Example 1: Daily Morning Routine**
- Set time to 09:00
- Configure 34 searches (typical daily limit)
- Enable auto-close
- Click Schedule
- Searches run automatically **every day** at 9 AM
- Cancel anytime to stop the daily schedule

**Example 2: Daily Lunch Break Automation**
- Set time to 12:30
- Configure your preferred settings
- Schedule for later today (if before 12:30 PM) or tomorrow
- Searches will run **every day** at 12:30 PM
- Extension handles everything automatically in the background

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Close Not Working
- Make sure the checkbox is checked before starting searches
- The feature only works when searches complete successfully
- Tabs close 2 seconds after the last search finishes

### Schedule Not Triggering
- Verify the extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- Check that your computer/browser is running at the scheduled time
- Ensure you didn't cancel the schedule accidentally
- Check the browser's alarm permissions

### General Tips
- You can still use "Start Searches" for immediate execution
- The manual "Close All Tabs" button works independently of auto-close
- All original features work exactly as before

## Best Practices

1. **For Daily Automation**: Schedule searches for a time when your computer is reliably on (e.g., morning or lunch)
2. **For Testing**: Start with immediate searches to verify your settings work before scheduling
3. **For Maximum Automation**: Enable auto-close with scheduled searches for completely hands-free operation
4. **For Manual Review**: Disable auto-close if you want to review tabs before closing them
5. **Set and Forget**: Once scheduled, searches run automatically every day - no need to remember or manually start them
6. **Keep Browser Running**: Ensure Chrome/Edge runs in the background for scheduled searches to execute
