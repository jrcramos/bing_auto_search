### Configuration Tips

#### Search Count Settings
- **New users**: Start with 10-20 searches to test
- **Regular users**: 30-35 searches for maximum daily points
- **Conservative approach**: 25-30 searches to stay well under limits
- **Never exceed 50** searches in a single session

#### Delay Settings
- **Minimum delay**: Never less than 3 seconds
- **Maximum delay**: 20-30 seconds for very natural behavior
- **Default (5-15s)**: Good balance of speed and naturalness
